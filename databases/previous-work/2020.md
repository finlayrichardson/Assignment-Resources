1b(i)

Customers pay for completed jobs on the day they take their car out of the garage.

The company wants to list the total sales for each of its five garages on 19 January 2020.

Implement the SQL statement that will produce an output with the headings:

| garageName | Total sales |
| ---------- | ----------- |

```sql
SELECT garageName, SUM(cost) AS "Total sales"
FROM Job, Garage
WHERE Job.garageID = Garage.garageID
AND dateOut = "19-Jan-20"
GROUP BY garageName;
```

1b(ii)

The company wants to identify the details of the car that spent the most number of days in any of its garages.

Implement two SQL statements that will find the highest number of days, the registration number and the name of the garage where the car was repaired.

| Number of days | regNo | garageName |
| -------------- | ----- | ---------- |

```sql
SELECT [Number of Days], Job.regNo, garageName
FROM (SELECT Max(dateOut-dateIn) AS [Number of Days] FROM Job), Job, Garage
WHERE (dateOut-dateIn) = [Number of Days]
AND Job.garageID = Garage.garageID;
```
